DESCRIPTION:Electrogals 2010 - Call & Response\nAll Women - All Electron
 ic\n\nThe concert will showcase female electronic music performers from 
 Portland and the West Coast\, featuring synthesists\, sonic explorers\, 
 deep listeners\, circuit benders\, and beat manglers. The performances w
 ill cover a wide range of styles\, from beat-heavy song forms to abstrac
 t noise-generated soundscapes. Some of the performances will also includ
 e the audience\, in ways that will definitely surprise and delight - and
  no\, there won't be any embarrassing sing-alongs. Probably.\n\nAbout th
 e Electrogals series\n\nAlthough there is nothing inherently manly about
  creating or performing electronic music\, the female electronic musicia
 n is something of a rare bird. Electrogals 2010 will be the fourth in th
 is series of showcases for women who have immersed themselves in this ar
 t form.\n\nThe first Electrogals show happened in 1995 at Mills College 
 in Oakland\, when composer Heather Perkins gathered a group of female el
 ectronic musicians for a show at the Mills Concert Hall. In 2004\, Heath
 er put on another Electrogals concert as part of the Sound/Craft music s
 eries at the Portland Museum of Contemporary Craft. In the spring of 200
 8\, Heather Perkins\, Mary Wright and Christi Denton put on an Electroga
 ls concert at Holocene\, filling both stages with an amazing lineup.\n\n
 All compositions for Electrogals 2010 will be written by Portland compos
 er and performer Heather Perkins\, and performed by an all-star roster o
 f female electronic music performers.\n\nNOTE: The time isn't listed on 
 the website\, it could be inaccurate.\n\nTags:\nart\, electronic\, music

DESCRIPTION:WHO: Corrina Black\nCorrina Black grew up sketching pictures
  and cartoons\, but didn’t turn to design until she discovered the Web a
 nd taught herself to design and code simple websites. She focused instin
 ctively on user flow\, interaction\, and attractive solutions. Corrina i
 s currently a UX Designer on the Microsoft Developer Division team. To b
 roaden her impact\, Corrina pursued a software engineering degree to com
 bine with her passion for user experience design. For Corrina\, user exp
 erience is what matters. A product that doesn’t solve a problem\, is dif
 ficult to use\, and doesn’t draw the user in\, regardless of how amazing
  the technology\, will fail.\n\nTOPIC: Creating Great UX with Expression
  Blend\nCorrina will do an intro to Blend and walkthrough the process of
  creating a great user experience\; this will involve SketchFlow because
  detailing and iterating on user flow\, layout\, and animations and tran
 sitions prior to full-scale implementation is key to great UX design and
  this is done in tools like SketchFlow. She will also likely walkthrough
  the process of building a simple application in Blend to show the core 
 functionality of Blend (maybe create a phone application).\n\nWarmup - T
 he Reactive Framework (Rx) in Silverlight\nAt the beginning of the meeti
 ng (6pm) our own Eric Sterling of Vertigo will be giving a short introdu
 ction to Rx. Have you had trouble writing asynchronous code (including u
 nit testing code)? If so\, Rx offers a compelling and syntactically attr
 active way of handling events.\n\nTags:\nexpression blend\, padnug\, sil

DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Monday\, July 19\, 2010 at midnight thr
 ough Friday\, July 23\, 2010 at midnight.\n\n Description:\nIf the first
  years of OSCON were about opening the minds of big business to the phil
 osophy of open source\, are the years ahead about opening the minds of t
 he open source community to the possibilities of its future? As open sou
 rce becomes fully integrated into the corporate environment\, OSCON help
 s to define\, maintain\, and extend the identity of what it means to be 
 open source.\n\nOSCON focuses on the substance of technology\, not the s
 hadow\, filtering the information that most merits attention and prepari
 ng participants for curves and challenges in the coming year and beyond.
  OSCON is the place to be inspired and challenged\, renew bonds to commu
 nity\, make new connections\, and find ways to give back to the open sou
 rce movement. OSCON has also become one of the most important places to 
 make open source related announcements\, and to unveil projects and prod
 ucts.\n\nOpen source is a fundamental principle at the core of many esta
 blished and emerging technologies\, driving the future of the computer i
 ndustry. OSCON explores the open source technologies that are here to st
 ay\, what will broaden the foundation\, and what will lead the way to un
 expected places and innovations.\n\n"For those who have not been to OSCO
 N\, it's a great technical conference covering the whole spectrum of ope
 n source\, including Linux\, MySQL\, the LAMP stack\, Perl\, Python\, Ru
 by on Rails\, middleware\, applications\, cloud computing\, and more. OS
 CON always has great keynotes\, tutorials\, and evening Birds-of-a-Feath
 er sessions. As with many conferences\, a lot of the meat takes place in
  hallway conversations and impromptu sessions."\n- Zack Urlocker\, InfoW

DESCRIPTION:EPISODE #7!\n\nGet up early and work on your side projects w
 ith some like-minded geeks!\n\nTechCoffee is part running club\, part kn
 itting bee\, and part hackathon. It's hard to work on all of your amazin
 g ideas after a long workday\, so instead we get up early. And we get to
 gether\, so we have the reinforcement of other people up early\, too. A 
 couple hours a week can make a big difference.\n\nSo bring your laptops 
 and your work ethic to the 3rd weekly PDX TechCoffee. One commit a week 
 is all we ask.\n\nNOTE: We've had some wifi problems in the past\, so i 
 recommend having what you need to work locally on your laptop before you
  come by.\n\nTags:\ncoffee\, geeks\, northeast

 elopment are a top-of-mind priority for many Oregonians. These candidate

 ss community to ask the candidates from each party what they would do to
  help support business and economic growth in Oregon. \n\nThe Democratic
  Gubernatorial Candidate forum will take place on Wednesday\, April 7 at
