DESCRIPTION:WHO: Corrina Black\nCorrina Black grew up sketching pictures 
 and cartoons\, but didn’t turn to design until she discovered the Web 
 and taught herself to design and code simple websites. She focused insti
 nctively on user flow\, interaction\, and attractive solutions. Corrina 
 is currently a UX Designer on the Microsoft Developer Division team. To 
 broaden her impact\, Corrina pursued a software engineering degree to co
 mbine with her passion for user experience design. For Corrina\, user ex
 perience is what matters. A product that doesn’t solve a problem\, is 
 difficult to use\, and doesn’t draw the user in\, regardless of how am
 azing the technology\, will fail.\n\nTOPIC: Creating Great UX with Expre
 ssion Blend\nCorrina will do an intro to Blend and walkthrough the proce
 ss of creating a great user experience\; this will involve SketchFlow be
 cause detailing and iterating on user flow\, layout\, and animations and
  transitions prior to full-scale implementation is key to great UX desig
 n and this is done in tools like SketchFlow. She will also likely walkth
 rough the process of building a simple application in Blend to show the 
 core functionality of Blend (maybe create a phone application).\n\nWarmu
 p - The Reactive Framework (Rx) in Silverlight\nAt the beginning of the 
 meeting (6pm) our own Eric Sterling of Vertigo will be giving a short in
 troduction to Rx. Have you had trouble writing asynchronous code (includ
 ing unit testing code)? If so\, Rx offers a compelling and syntactically
  attractive way of handling events.\n\nTags:\nexpression blend\, padnug\

 ell as share some valuable lessons of what to avoid. Learning from their
  insights and knowledge will undoubtedly help you in your decision makin

 earned a degree in journalism…which led to a career writing for newspa

  if you’re not an engineer). To that end\, Susan managed PR and market

DESCRIPTION:Electrogals 2010 - Call & Response\nAll Women - All Electroni
 c\n\nThe concert will showcase female electronic music performers from P
 ortland and the West Coast\, featuring synthesists\, sonic explorers\, d
 eep listeners\, circuit benders\, and beat manglers. The performances wi
 ll cover a wide range of styles\, from beat-heavy song forms to abstract
  noise-generated soundscapes. Some of the performances will also include
  the audience\, in ways that will definitely surprise and delight - and 
 no\, there won't be any embarrassing sing-alongs. Probably.\n\nAbout the
  Electrogals series\n\nAlthough there is nothing inherently manly about 
 creating or performing electronic music\, the female electronic musician
  is something of a rare bird. Electrogals 2010 will be the fourth in thi
 s series of showcases for women who have immersed themselves in this art
  form.\n\nThe first Electrogals show happened in 1995 at Mills College i
 n Oakland\, when composer Heather Perkins gathered a group of female ele
 ctronic musicians for a show at the Mills Concert Hall. In 2004\, Heathe
 r put on another Electrogals concert as part of the Sound/Craft music se
 ries at the Portland Museum of Contemporary Craft. In the spring of 2008
 \, Heather Perkins\, Mary Wright and Christi Denton put on an Electrogal
 s concert at Holocene\, filling both stages with an amazing lineup.\n\nA
 ll compositions for Electrogals 2010 will be written by Portland compose
 r and performer Heather Perkins\, and performed by an all-star roster of
  female electronic music performers.\n\nNOTE: The time isn't listed on t
 he website\, it could be inaccurate.\n\nTags:\nart\, electronic\, music

DESCRIPTION:This event runs from Monday\, July 19\, 2010 at midnight thro
 ugh Friday\, July 23\, 2010 at midnight.\n\n Description:\nIf the first 
 years of OSCON were about opening the minds of big business to the philo
 sophy of open source\, are the years ahead about opening the minds of th
 e open source community to the possibilities of its future? As open sour
 ce becomes fully integrated into the corporate environment\, OSCON helps
  to define\, maintain\, and extend the identity of what it means to be o
 pen source.\n\nOSCON focuses on the substance of technology\, not the sh
 adow\, filtering the information that most merits attention and preparin
 g participants for curves and challenges in the coming year and beyond. 
 OSCON is the place to be inspired and challenged\, renew bonds to commun
 ity\, make new connections\, and find ways to give back to the open sour
 ce movement. OSCON has also become one of the most important places to m
 ake open source related announcements\, and to unveil projects and produ
 cts.\n\nOpen source is a fundamental principle at the core of many estab
 lished and emerging technologies\, driving the future of the computer in
 dustry. OSCON explores the open source technologies that are here to sta
 y\, what will broaden the foundation\, and what will lead the way to une
 xpected places and innovations.\n\n"For those who have not been to OSCON
 \, it's a great technical conference covering the whole spectrum of open
